#### Answer No 1
Insights:
- The top 5 best-selling products in the "Mobiles & Tablets" category are: IDROIX_BALRX7-Gold, IDROIX_BALRX7-Jet Black, Infinix Hot 4-Gold, Samsung_Grand Prime Plus-Black, and Infinix_Zero 4-Grey
- IDROIX_BALRX7-Gold is the clear top-seller with 1,000 units sold. The sales gap between this product and the second-place product, IDROIX_BALRX7-Jet Black, which only sold 31 units, is substantial
- This significant gap could be attributed to differences in price, features, smartphone models, or customer preferences.

Recommendations:
- IDROIX_BALRX7-Gold is the ideal item for the grand prize of the year-end festival competition. Its high sales volume and popularity could lead to increased participation
- While the other top-selling products only sold between 10 and 31 units, they could be used as second or third prizes as an alternative way to promote these products
- However, due to the low sales volume of the other products in the top 5 list, they may not be a strong incentive for participants. Therefore, offering other best-selling products from different categories could be a more effective alternative to maintain high participant interest.

#### Answer No 2.1
Insights:
- The 'Others' category experienced the most significant sales decline, with a negative growth of 163 items compared to the previous year, highlighting it as the category with the lowest performance
- Other categories that also showed a decrease in sales are 'Soghaat' (-147 items), 'Men Fashion' (-15 items), and 'Beauty & Grooming' (-12 items)
- This indicates a broader issue with a portion of the inventory not meeting market demand, leading to excess stock, particularly in the 'Others' category
  
Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough analysis and evaluation of the marketing strategies for these declining categories by studying current market trends, seasonal demand, and recent product updates
- Implement a customer satisfaction survey specifically for items within these low-performing categories to better understand consumer preferences and identify potential issues
- To clear unsold stock, initiate tactical promotions such as warehouse clearance sales, product bundling, and bonus promos for purchasing certain items
- If a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with suppliers exists, consider returning products to mitigate further losses

#### Answer No 2.2
Insights:
- The item with the most significant sales decrease in the 'Others' category is RB_Dettol Germ Busting Kit-bf, which sold 155 fewer items than the previous year
- Other products in this category that experienced a sales decline did so by less than 25 items, making the RB_Dettol Germ Busting Kit-bf an outlier
- Given that this product is a sanitizing and healthcare item, its steep decline could be an indicator of a dynamic shift in market trends and consumer demand within this specific segment.

Recommendations:
- Conduct a deeper analysis into the market segmentation for the products with decreasing sales to understand which consumer groups are no longer purchasing them
- Boost sales for these specific products by launching targeted marketing campaigns and promotional offers
